# SQL-Manager-Library

In this project I created a list of library books using Node.js, Express, Sequelize and Pug. The user is able to update, create and delete books from the directory.

To access this project, simply:
  * Clone the repo using either a https key or ssh key
  * Install the dependencies by typing ***npm install*** in the terminal 
  * Once all the dependencies have been installed, type ***npm start*** in the terminal
